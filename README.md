## About

This is the Jekyll-based website for [microservices.io](http://microservices.io/index.html)


## Usage

In order to run the webite locally first you should install the project's dependencies using [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```bash
bundle install
```

After that [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) should be installed on your computer. To compile and run the site, you can type the following commands into your terminal:

```bash
jekyll build
jekyll serve
```

Now the site should be up and running locally. If you didn't specify otherwise, the site will be running on port 4000: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
